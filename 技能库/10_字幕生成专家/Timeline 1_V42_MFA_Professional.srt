1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,240
Hey you're runnin' from what you can't escape

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,120
Come my way I'll put you under some kind of state

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,940
So watch me hypnotize you with my eyes

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,540
Make you fantasize about me tonight

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,140
I'm hypnotizing

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:31,890
Side to side got you hypnotized

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,440
Cause every time my clock tick-tock like this

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,040
Every little spell I cast don't miss

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,640
Always on top top top I'm hypnotizing

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,049
Got you doing what I want want want all night

11
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:52,649
Wake up to the click of sound

12
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:55,349
Follow with your eyes

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,080
Watch me watch me hypnotize

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,459
You'll be where I want you every night

15
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,190
You'll be back to feed your appetite

16
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,599
Swirling hypno disco illusion

17
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,699
My command becomes your reason

18
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,750
In your consciousness

19
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:17,379
Now your mind is of no consequence

20
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,979
I bet you never seen a girl so confident

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,570
Cut the compliments that's just common sense

22
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,229
I'm super shy, super shy

23
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:27,309
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine

24
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:33,709
떨리는 지금도 You're on my mind all the time

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,269
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy

26
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:36,330
And I want to go out with you

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:38,790
Where you want to go (Huh?)

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,870
Find a lil spot, just sit and talk

29
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,970
Looking pretty, follow me

30
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,570
우리 둘이 나란히

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,170
보이지? 내 눈이

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:48,920
갑자기 빛나지

33
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,480
When you say I'm your dream

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,980
You don't even know my name, do ya?

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,580
누구보다도

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,180
나 원래 말도 잘하고 그러는데 왜 이런지

37
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:38,849
I don't like that

38
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,800
Something odd about you

39
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,820
Yeah, you're special and you know it

40
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,510
You're the top, babe

41
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,290
You're running from where you can't escape

42
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,890
I put you under some kind of state

43
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:14,960
I'm hypnotizing

44
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,560
Make you fantasize

45
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,160
Side to side, got you hypnotized
