1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:09,860
Hey you're runnin' from what you can't escape

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,819
Come my way I'll put you under some kind of state

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,960
So watch me hypnotize you with my eyes

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:26,540
Make you fantasize about me tonight

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,200
I'm hypnotizing

6
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:32,229
Side to side got you hypnotized

7
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:49,479
Cause every time my clock tick-tock like this

8
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:51,299
Every little spell I cast don't miss

9
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:55,060
Always on top top top I'm hypnotizing

10
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,700
Got you doing what I want want want all night

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,310
Wake up to the click of sound

12
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,060
Follow with your eyes

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,190
Watch me watch me hypnotize

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,920
You'll be where I want you every night

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,159
You'll be back to feed your appetite

16
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,969
Swirling hypno disco illusion

17
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:09,820
My command becomes your reason

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,560
In your consciousness

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:22,640
Now your mind is of no consequence

20
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:27,659
I bet you never seen a girl so confident

21
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:31,259
Cut the compliments that's just common sense

22
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:33,430
I'm super shy, super shy

23
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,530
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine

24
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,000
떨리는 지금도 You're on my mind all the time

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,899
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy

26
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:44,619
And I want to go out with you

27
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,240
Where you want to go (Huh?)

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,070
Find a lil spot, just sit and talk

29
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,729
Looking pretty, follow me

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
우리 둘이 나란히

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
보이지? 내 눈이

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
갑자기 빛나지

33
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:50,219
When you say I'm your dream

34
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:53,049
You don't even know my name, do ya?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,200
누구보다도

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
나 원래 말도 잘하고 그러는데 왜 이런지

37
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:53,990
I don't like that

38
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,950
Something odd about you

39
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,119
Yeah, you're special and you know it

40
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,030
You're the top, babe

41
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,229
You're running from where you can't escape

42
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:00,310
I put you under some kind of state

43
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,860
I'm hypnotizing

44
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,810
Make you fantasize

45
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:11,080
Side to side, got you hypnotized
